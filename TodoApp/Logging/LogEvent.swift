///
/// - info: Generally useful information to log (service start/stop, configuration assumptions, etc). Info to always have available but usually don't care about under normal circumstances. Out-of-the-box config level.
/// - debug: Information that is helpful to developers to diagnose an issue.
/// - verbose: Use to trace the code, trying to find one part of a function specifically, sort of debugging with extensive information.
/// - warning: Anything that can potentially cause application oddities but an automatic recovery is possible (such as retrying an operation, missing data, etc.)
/// - error: Any error which is fatal to the operation, but not the service or application (can't open a required file, missing data, etc.). These errors will force user intervention. These are usually reserved for failed API calls, missing services, etc.
